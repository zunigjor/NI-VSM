The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair
it was four o clock when the ceremony was over and the carriages began to arrive there had been a crowd following all the way owing to the exuberance of marija berczynskas the occasion rested heavily upon marija s broad shoulders it was her task to see that all things went in due form and after the best home traditions and flying wildly hither and thither bowling every one out of the way and scolding and exhorting all day with her tremendous voice marija was too eager to see that others conformed to the proprieties to consider them herself she had left the church last of all and desiring to arrive first at the hall had issued orders to the coachman to drive faster when that personage had developed a will of his own in the matter marija had flung up the window of the carriage and leaning out proceeded to tell him her opinion of him first in lithuanian which he did not understand and then in polish which he did having the advantage of her in altitude the driver had stood his ground and even ventured to attempt to speak and the result had been a furious altercation which continuing all the way down ashland avenue had added a new swarm of urchins to the cortege at each side street for half a mile this was unfortunate for already there was a throng before the door the music had started up and half a block away you could hear the dull broom broom of a cello with the squeaking of two fiddles which vied with each other in intricate and altitudinous gymnastics seeing the throng marija abandoned precipitately the debate concerning the ancestors of her coachman and springing from the moving carriage plunged in and proceeded to clear a way to the hall once within she turned and began to push the other way roaring meantime eik eik uzdaryk duris in tones which made the orchestral uproar sound like fairy music z graiczunas pasilinksminimams darzas vynas sznapsas wines and liquors union headquarters that was the way the signs ran the reader who perhaps has never held much converse in the language of far off lithuania will be glad of the explanation that the place was the rear room of a saloon in that part of chicago known as back of the yards this information is definite and suited to the matter of fact but how pitifully inadequate it would have seemed to one who understood that it was also the supreme hour of ecstasy in the life of one of god s gentlest creatures the scene of the wedding feast and the joy transfiguration of little ona lukoszaite she stood in the doorway shepherded by cousin marija breathless from pushing through the crowd and in her happiness painful to look upon there was a light of wonder in her eyes and her lids trembled and her otherwise wan little face was flushed she wore a muslin dress conspicuously white and a stiff little veil coming to her shoulders there were five pink paper roses twisted in the veil and eleven bright green rose leaves there were new white cotton gloves upon her hands and as she stood staring about her she twisted them together feverishly it was almost too much for her you could see the pain of too great emotion in her face and all the tremor of her form she was so young not quite sixteen and small for her age a mere child and she had just been married and married to jurgis pronounced yoorghis of all men to jurgis rudkus he with the white flower in the buttonhole of his new black suit he with the mighty shoulders and the giant hands ona was blue eyed and fair while jurgis had great black eyes with beetling brows and thick black hair that curled in waves about his ears in short they were one of those incongruous and impossible married couples with which mother nature so often wills to confound all prophets before and after jurgis could take up a two hundred and fifty pound quarter of beef and carry it into a car without a stagger or even a thought and now he stood in a far corner frightened as a hunted animal and obliged to moisten his lips with his tongue each time before he could answer the congratulations of his friends gradually there was effected a separation between the spectators and the guests a separation at least sufficiently complete for working purposes there was no time during the festivities which ensued when there were not groups of onlookers in the doorways and the corners and if any one of these onlookers came sufficiently close or looked sufficiently hungry a chair was offered him and he was invited to the feast it was one of the laws of the veselija that no one goes hungry and while a rule made in the forests of lithuania is hard to apply in the stockyards district of chicago with its quarter of a million inhabitants still they did their best and the children who ran in from the street and even the dogs went out again happier a charming informality was one of the characteristics of this celebration the men wore their hats or if they wished they took them off and their coats with them they ate when and where they pleased and moved as often as they pleased there were to be speeches and singing but no one had to listen who did not care to if he wished meantime to speak or sing himself he was perfectly free the resulting medley of sound distracted no one save possibly alone the babies of which there were present a number equal to the total possessed by all the guests invited there was no other place for the babies to be and so part of the preparations for the evening consisted of a collection of cribs and carriages in one corner in these the babies slept three or four together or wakened together as the case might be those who were still older and could reach
