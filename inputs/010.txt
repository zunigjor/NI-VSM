Ulysses, by James Joyce
stately plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed a yellow dressinggown ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air he held the bowl aloft and intoned introibo ad altare dei halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely come up kinch come up you fearful jesuit solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains then catching sight of stephen dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head stephen dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hair grained and hued like pale oak buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly back to barracks he said sternly he added in a preachers tone for this o dearly beloved is the genuine christine body and soul and blood and ouns slow music please shut your eyes gents one moment a little trouble about those white corpuscles silence all he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points chrysostomos two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm thanks old chap he cried briskly that will do nicely switch off the current will you he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips the mockery of it he said gaily your absurd name an ancient greek he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself stephen dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck buck mulligans gay voice went on my name is absurd too malachi mulligan two dactyls but it has a hellenic ring hasnt it tripping and sunny like the buck himself we must go to athens will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid he laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried will he come the jejune jesuit ceasing he began to shave with care tell me mulligan stephen said quietly yes my love how long is haines going to stay in this tower buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder god isnt he dreadful he said frankly a ponderous saxon he thinks youre not a gentleman god these bloody english bursting with money and indigestion because he comes from oxford you know dedalus you have the real oxford manner he cant make you out o my name for you is the best kinch the knife blade he shaved warily over his chin he was raving all night about a black panther stephen said where is his guncase a woful lunatic mulligan said were you in a funk i was stephen said with energy and growing fear out here in the dark with a man i dont know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther you saved men from drowning im not a hero however if he stays on here i am off buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily scutter he cried thickly he came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into stephens upper pocket said lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly then gazing over the handkerchief he said the bards noserag a new art colour for our irish poets snotgreen you can almost taste it cant you he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly god he said quietly isnt the sea what algy calls it a great sweet mother the snotgreen sea the scrotumtightening sea epi oinopa ponton ah dedalus the greeks i must teach you you must read them in the original thalatta thalatta she is our great sweet mother come and look stephen stood up and went over to the parapet leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of kingstown our mighty mother buck mulligan said he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephens face the aunt thinks you killed your mother he said thats why she wont let me have anything to do with you someone killed her stephen said gloomily you could have knelt down damn it kinch when your dying mother asked you buck mulligan said im hyperborean as much as you but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her and you refused there is something sinister in you he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek a tolerant smile curled his lips but a lovely mummer he murmured to himself kinch the loveliest mummer of them all he shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously stephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat sleeve pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade ah poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice i must give you a shirt and a few noserags how are the secondhand breeks they fit well enough stephen answered buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip the mockery of it he said contentedly secondleg they should be god knows what poxy bowsy left them off i have a lovely pair with a hair stripe grey youll look spiffing in them im not joking kinch you look damn well when youre dressed thanks stephen said i cant wear them if they are grey he cant wear them buck mulligan told his face in the mirror etiquette is etiquette he kills his mother but he cant wear grey trousers he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes that fellow i was with in the ship last night said buck mulligan says you have g p i hes up in dottyville with connolly norman general paralysis of the insane he swept the mirror a half circle in the air
