The Republic, by Plato
the republic persons of the dialogue socrates who is the narrator glaucon adeimantus polemarchus cephalus thrasymachus cleitophon and others who are mute auditors the scene is laid in the house of cephalus at the piraeus and the whole dialogue is narrated by socrates the day after it actually took place to timaeus hermocrates critias and a nameless person who are introduced in the timaeus book i i went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son of ariston that i might offer up my prayers to the goddess bendis the thracian artemis and also because i wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival which was a new thing i was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants but that of the thracians was equally if not more beautiful when we had finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle we turned in the direction of the city and at that instant polemarchus the son of cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home and told his servant to run and bid us wait for him the servant took hold of me by the cloak behind and said polemarchus desires you to wait i turned round and asked him where his master was there he is said the youth coming after you if you will only wait certainly we will said glaucon and in a few minutes polemarchus appeared and with him adeimantus glaucon s brother niceratus the son of nicias and several others who had been at the procession polemarchus said to me i perceive socrates that you and your companion are already on your way to the city you are not far wrong i said but do you see he rejoined how many we are of course and are you stronger than all these for if not you will have to remain where you are may there not be the alternative i said that we may persuade you to let us go but can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you he said certainly not replied glaucon then we are not going to listen of that you may be assured adeimantus added has no one told you of the torch race on horseback in honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening with horses i replied that is a novelty will horsemen carry torches and pass them one to another during the race yes said polemarchus and not only so but a festival will be celebrated at night which you certainly ought to see let us rise soon after supper and see this festival there will be a gathering of young men and we will have a good talk stay then and do not be perverse glaucon said i suppose since you insist that we must very good i replied accordingly we went with polemarchus to his house and there we found his brothers lysias and euthydemus and with them thrasymachus the chalcedonian charmantides the paeanian and cleitophon the son of aristonymus there too was cephalus the father of polemarchus whom i had not seen for a long time and i thought him very much aged he was seated on a cushioned chair and had a garland on his head for he had been sacrificing in the court and there were some other chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle upon which we sat down by him he saluted me eagerly and then he said you don t come to see me socrates as often as you ought if i were still able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me but at my age i can hardly get to the city and therefore you should come oftener to the piraeus for let me tell you that the more the pleasures of the body fade away the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of conversation do not then deny my request but make our house your resort and keep company with these young men we are old friends and you will be quite at home with us i replied there is nothing which for my part i like better cephalus than conversing with aged men for i regard them as travellers who have gone a journey which i too may have to go and of whom i ought to enquire whether the way is smooth and easy or rugged and difficult and this is a question which i should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call the threshold of old age is life harder towards the end or what report do you give of it i will tell you socrates he said what my own feeling is men of my age flock together we are birds of a feather as the old proverb says and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is i cannot eat i cannot drink the pleasures of youth and love are fled away there was a good time once but now that is gone and life is no longer life some complain of the slights which are put upon them by relations and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the cause but to me socrates these complainers seem to blame that which is not really in fault for if old age were the cause i too being old and every other old man would have felt as they do but this is not my own experience nor that of others whom i have known how well i remember the aged poet sophocles when in answer to the question how does love suit with age sophocles are you still the man you were peace he replied most gladly have i escaped the thing of which you speak i feel as if i had escaped from a mad and furious master his words have often occurred to my mind since and they seem as good to me now as at the time when he uttered them for certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom when the passions relax their hold then as sophocles says we are freed from the grasp not of one mad master only but of many the truth is socrates that these regrets and also the complaints about relations are to be attributed to the same cause which is not old age but men s characters and tempers for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of age but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are equally a burden i listened in admiration and wanting to draw him out that he might go on yes cephalus i said but i rather suspect that people in general are not convinced by you when you speak thus they think that old age sits lightly upon you not because of your happy disposition but because you are rich and wealth is well known to be a great comforter you are right he replied they are not convinced and there is something in what they say not however so much as they imagine i might answer them as themistocles answered the seriphian who was abusing him and saying that he was famous not for his own merits but because he was an athenian if you
