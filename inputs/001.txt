Pierrot, Dog of Belgium, by Walter A. Dyer
the children called him pierrot from the first that is of course no proper name for a flemish dog but you see mere marie had come from dinant where almost everybody speaks french and she had been taught french in school besides she had french friends in brussels and was very fond of everything french and warm and southern so she had often told the children stories about harlequin and columbine and pierrot and when they saw what a comical clumsy little fellow the puppy was and how much he looked as though he wore big baggy breeches henri called him drole pierrot and wee lisa clapped her fat little hands and laughed shrilly jean van huyk had brought pierrot home in his arms one spring evening and had tumbled him out upon the floor of the cottage to startle henri and lisa but they refused to be frightened for henri was learning the rules of courage and lisa thought at first that the puppy was a baby lamb straightway she fell upon him and sought to hug him to her plump little bosom but pierrot only bit her ear and made her squeal with delight and then wriggled out of her arms and hurriedly waddled over to henri who rolled him over on his back and tickled his round little stomach whereat pere jean roared loudly and old granpere cackled from his chair then shaggy old luppe who had pulled mere maries milk cart for seven years yawned tremendously dragged himself laboriously to his feet stalked over from the doorway and sniffed at pierrot and then turned back with a look of dignified boredom by this ceremony pierrot was constituted an accepted member of the household it was luppes advancing years in fact that explained the coming of pierrot it was sad to think of the day when the old fellow would no longer be able to trot into town with the milk and cheese but providence has set narrow boundaries to a dogs life and mere marie would soon need a younger and stronger steed so one sunday morning pere jean had bade henri dress himself in his best clothes for they were to drive into brussels to the dog market and half the world would be there the belgians do not think it strange to go to market on sunday for it is an entirely different kind of market from those conducted on week days and they put on their gay clothes and make a holiday of it when pere jean and henri arrived the city was already alive with people and they made a pleasant sight in the bright sunshine pere jean found a place to tie his horse and then they hastened directly to the grande place this was a great paved square with imposing buildings on all sides such as the hotel de ville and the maison du roi there were a great many people in the square and they were all very lively and busy and jolly one side of the square looked like a great garden for here was the flower market and the florists vied with each other in their displays of plants and cut flowers it was very beautiful also it smelled wonderfully sweet so that henri fell under a sort of enchantment and pere jean had to drag him away on another side of the square were parrots and cockatoos and canaries and birds of all kinds in little wooden cages some of the parrots were making comical efforts to talk like people the song birds were whistling and trilling and all was gay and colourful which delighted henri but they had a bird of their own at home and it was not birds that pere jean had come to see at length they came to the dog market four or five hundred dogs of all ages and sizes and colours lay dozing or stood pulling at their leashes there were big strong dogs like luppe alert black schipperkes brussels griffons with faces like those of little bearded old men belgian sheep dogs with erect pointed ears short haired brown fellows and beautiful long haired black ones all sorts of dogs from great danes to ridiculous little dachshunds there were capable looking work dogs mournful eyed mothers swaggering young bloods proclaiming loudly their desire for battle awkward blundering adorable four month olds and fuzzy little babies that wabbled on their sprawling legs as though made of jelly henri saw a dozen dogs that would have suited him perfectly but pere jean was apparently more difficult to please for he went from group to group without making a selection at last he told henri that he could not find the sort of dog he wanted and that it was better to go home without any than take one that would not turn out well henri looked down the row of assuredly desirable dogs and his lip began to tremble a little so pere jean instead of taking henri home at once bought some cakes for their dinner and told him he should remain to hear the grand concert in the afternoon which pleased henri so much that he forgot his disappointment at noon there was a great hubbub and bustle in the grande place for the market was over and all the vendors must be out of there at once in the afternoon the regimental band came in its wonderful uniforms and played stirring music in the kiosk until the shadows began to lengthen and henri grew very weary it had been a wonderful day and henri fell asleep that night with gay pictures dancing before his eyes and music sounding in his ears this was happiness enough for little henri but pere jean had not found the dog he was after he knew the value of the right kind of dog and he would have nothing else so pere jean made a journey one day to fat auguste naets the butcher of vilvorde who was famous for the dogs he bred auguste bragged much about these dogs their blood he said ran away back into the middle ages to the boarhounds of the dukes of brabant matins he called them and it is true that for a hundred years when other men had grown careless of their breeding augustes father and grandfather and great grandfather had kept the breed pure so that when the national federation for the breeding of draft dogs was founded a dozen years ago they deemed the naets strain worthy of a certificate of merit with five red seals attached which auguste proudly had framed and hung in his shop of the hundred thousand or more dogs that are used in belgium as chiens de trait none were finer than those which pere jean found in the kennels of auguste naets they were large dogs with something of the look of the st bernard about them but with smaller heads and more lithe and rangy bodies in colour they were all sorts of combinations of black white and tawny auguste held that colour meant nothing to a cart dog their ears were long and drooping
