The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Complete by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)
preface most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred one or two were experiences of my own the rest those of boys who were schoolmates of mine huck finn is drawn from life tom sawyer also but not from an individual he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom i knew and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture the odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and slaves in the west at the period of this story that is to say thirty or forty years ago although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls i hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves and of how they felt and thought and talked and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in the author hartford chapter i tom no answer tom no answer what s gone with that boy i wonder you tom no answer the old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room then she put them up and looked out under them she seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy they were her state pair the pride of her heart and were built for style not service she could have seen through a pair of stove lids just as well she looked perplexed for a moment and then said not fiercely but still loud enough for the furniture to hear well i lay if i get hold of you i ll she did not finish for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with she resurrected nothing but the cat i never did see the beat of that boy she went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and jimpson weeds that constituted the garden no tom so she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted y o u u tom there was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight there i might a thought of that closet what you been doing in there nothing nothing look at your hands and look at your mouth what is that truck i don t know aunt well i know it s jam that s what it is forty times i ve said if you didn t let that jam alone i d skin you hand me that switch the switch hovered in the air the peril was desperate my look behind you aunt the old lady whirled round and snatched her skirts out of danger the lad fled on the instant scrambled up the high board fence and disappeared over it his aunt polly stood surprised a moment and then broke into a gentle laugh hang the boy can t i never learn anything ain t he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time but old fools is the biggest fools there is can t learn an old dog new tricks as the saying is but my goodness he never plays them alike two days and how is a body to know what s coming he pears to know just how long he can torment me before i get my dander up and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh it s all down again and i can t hit him a lick i ain t doing my duty by that boy and that s the lord s truth goodness knows spare the rod and spile the child as the good book says i m a laying up sin and suffering for us both i know he s full of the old scratch but laws a me he s my own dead sister s boy poor thing and i ain t got the heart to lash him somehow every time i let him off my conscience does hurt me so and every time i hit him my old heart most breaks well a well man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble as the scripture says and i reckon it s so he ll play hookey this evening and southwestern for afternoon i ll just be obleeged to make him work tomorrow to punish him it s mighty hard to make him work saturdays when all the boys is having holiday but he hates work more than he hates anything else and i ve got to do some of my duty by him or i ll be the ruination of the child tom did play hookey and he had a very good time he got back home barely in season to help jim the small colored boy saw next day s wood and split the kindlings before supper at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to jim while jim did three fourths of the work tom s younger brother or rather half brother sid was already through with his part of the work picking up chips for he was a quiet boy and had no adventurous trouble some ways while tom was eating his supper and stealing sugar as opportunity offered aunt polly asked him questions that were full of guile and very deep for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments like many other simple hearted souls it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning said she tom it was middling warm in school warn t it yes m powerful warm warn t it yes m didn t you want to go in a swimming tom a bit of a scare shot through tom a touch of uncomfortable suspicion he searched aunt polly s face but it told him nothing so he said no m well not very much the old lady reached out her hand and felt tom s shirt and said but you ain t too warm now though and it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind but in spite of her tom knew where the wind lay now so he forestalled what might be the next move some of us pumped on our heads mine s damp yet see aunt polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence and missed a trick then she had a new inspiration tom you didn t have to undo your shirt collar where i sewed it to pump on your head did you unbutton your jacket the trouble vanished out of tom s face he opened his jacket his shirt collar was securely sewed bother well go long with you i d made sure you d played hookey and been a swimming but i forgive ye tom i reckon you re a kind of a singed cat as the saying is better n you look this time she was half sorry her sagacity
