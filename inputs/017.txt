The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde
the artist is the creator of beautiful things to reveal art and conceal the artist is art s aim the critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things the highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming this is a fault those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated for these there is hope they are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty there is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book books are well written or badly written that is all the nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of caliban seeing his own face in a glass the nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of caliban not seeing his own face in a glass the moral life of man forms part of the subject matter of the artist but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium no artist desires to prove anything even things that are true can be proved no artist has ethical sympathies an ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style no artist is ever morbid the artist can express everything thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art from the point of view of form the type of all the arts is the art of the musician from the point of view of feeling the actor s craft is the type all art is at once surface and symbol those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril those who read the symbol do so at their peril it is the spectator and not life that art really mirrors diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new complex and vital when critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself we can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it the only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely all art is quite useless oscar wilde chapter the studio was filled with the rich odour of roses and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac or the more delicate perfume of the pink flowering thorn from the corner of the divan of persian saddle bags on which he was lying smoking as was his custom innumerable cigarettes lord henry wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey sweet and honey coloured blossoms of a laburnum whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window producing a kind of momentary japanese effect and making him think of those pallid jade faced painters of tokyo who through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion the sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine seemed to make the stillness more oppressive the dim roar of london was like the bourdon note of a distant organ in the centre of the room clamped to an upright easel stood the full length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty and in front of it some little distance away was sitting the artist himself basil hallward whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused at the time such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures as the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art a smile of pleasure passed across his face and seemed about to linger there but he suddenly started up and closing his eyes placed his fingers upon the lids as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake it is your best work basil the best thing you have ever done said lord henry languidly you must certainly send it next year to the grosvenor the academy is too large and too vulgar whenever i have gone there there have been either so many people that i have not been able to see the pictures which was dreadful or so many pictures that i have not been able to see the people which was worse the grosvenor is really the only place i don t think i shall send it anywhere he answered tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at oxford no i won t send it anywhere lord henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy opium tainted cigarette not send it anywhere my dear fellow why have you any reason what odd chaps you painters are you do anything in the world to gain a reputation as soon as you have one you seem to want to throw it away it is silly of you for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about a portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in england and make the old men quite jealous if old men are ever capable of any emotion i know you will laugh at me he replied but i really can t exhibit it i have put too much of myself into it lord henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed yes i knew you would but it is quite true all the same too much of yourself in it upon my word basil i didn t know you were so vain and i really can t see any resemblance between you with your rugged strong face and your coal black hair and this young adonis who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose leaves why my dear basil he is a narcissus and you well of course you have an intellectual expression and all that but beauty real beauty ends where an intellectual expression begins intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration and destroys the harmony of any face the moment one sits down to think one becomes all nose or all forehead or something horrid look at the successful men in any of the learned professions how perfectly hideous they are except of course in the church but then in the church they don t think a bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful your mysterious young friend whose name you have never told me but whose picture really fascinates me never thinks i feel quite sure of that he is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence
